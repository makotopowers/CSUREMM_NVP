What features/seasons would we like to consider when analyzing trends?

    -Price
    -Discount
    -Promise 
    -SKU attribute 1 
    -SKU attribute 2
    -User level 
    -Age
    -Marital Status 
    -Gender 
    -Education Level 
    -City Level 
    -Purchasing Power 

Group purchases/demand by feature/season and run analysis. Does it vary significantly from the analysis without seasons?

######| How to extract data by feature |######

1. First, merge tables with desired data features using the FeatureChooser class. 
2. Drop columns not needed and group by feature. Then, using df.to_numpy() to convert to numpy array, 
    with the rows the different feature values. 
3. Run analysis on each row of the numpy array. 



|quantity_discount_per_unit|  <- this could be any feature we want to analyze 
|--------------------------|
0                          | Time Series Data |    <- This is seasonal data for the quantity_discount_per_unit feature
1
5
10
20

    After to_numpy()


[[time series for qdpu =0  ], 
 [time series for qdpu =1  ],
 [time series for qdpu =5  ],
 [time series for qdpu =10 ],
 [time series for qdpu =20 ]]  <- Calculate mean for each row 


 Things to think about: 

    - If the regret/error is really high, should we not consdier the season/feature as a true season/feature?


Machine Learning (DNN) to figure out if there are correlations between the seasons.
