What features/seasons would we like to consider when analyzing trends?

    -Price
    -Discount
    -Promise 
    -SKU attribute 1 
    -SKU attribute 2
    -User level 
    -Age
    -Marital Status 
    -Gender 
    -Education Level 
    -City Level 
    -Purchasing Power 

Group purchases/demand by feature/season and run analysis. Does it vary significantly from the analysis without seasons?
